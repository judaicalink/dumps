# Datasets

## Content
This is the repository for the dumps of the datasests for JudaicaLink.
Here is an overview of the availabe datasets. 
https://web.judaicalink.org/datasets/

The repository serves to keep track of the changes and as backup for the data.

Each folder contains a dataset. The subfolder contains the version.

The folder `current` is default and holds the current data.

The data is stored as ttl or ttl.gz.


## Naming conventions

The files should be named as following:

`<dataset>-<subcategory>-YYYY-mm-dd.ttl.gz`

Gzipped is optional, also a suffix for time `-HH:MM` or a version number.

The folders should be named like `<dataset>\current`\ or `<dataset>\YYYY-mm-dd\`
